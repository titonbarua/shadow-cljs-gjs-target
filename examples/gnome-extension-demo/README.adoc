= How to develop Gnome extensions with ClojureScript

During development, you need to reload GnomeShell.

== Developemnt steps

* Work on your code
* Compile it with `npx shadow-cljs compile app`
* Reload the extension in Gnome Shell to test
** If running X - you can ALt+F2, type `r` and <Enter>
** If using Wayland, that migh not work, but you can start a new session very easily with `dbus-run-session -- gnome-shell --nested --wayland`
* Enjoy
